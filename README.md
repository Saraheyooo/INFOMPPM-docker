# üì∫ "WHAAA" - Docker Environment for Personalisation for (public) Media üì¢

## Install docker

Please follow the instruction for intstalling docker on you operating system: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Quickstart (build an image)
- `git clone https://github.com/gauthiier/INFOMPPM-docker.git`
- `cd INFOMPPM-docker`
- `./docker.sh build-dev` (‚ö°Ô∏ètakes a while at first)

This should create a docker image named "uu/infomppm". To see if the image was created properly simply run:
- `docker image ls` 

## Quickstart (run a container)
When the "uu/infomppm" is created you can simply start a container with the following:
- `./docker.sh run`

This will start a docker container name "whaaa" based on the "uu/infomppm" image. To exit a session simply enter `exit` while inside the container. Please note the container will be destroyed when you exit it. That said, everything that is in directories code/ data/ and manual/ will be saved on your machine.
